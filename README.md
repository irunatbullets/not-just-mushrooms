<h1>Not Just Mushrooms</h1>

**Not Just Mushrooms** is a decoration-focused mod that adds blocks and items I can’t believe never made it into vanilla.

I mean… how did we end up with all these mushrooms, but no way to stick them to walls or ceilings?

Mushrooms are the starting point, with other decorative and semi-functional additions planned over time.

## What's in the mod!

**Mushroom lamp** - A redstone powered mushroom lamp that can be placed almost anywhere! You can change its initial state by sneaking while placing it, or by right-clicking it with a redstone torch. You can also use levers, buttons, or any other redstone items to power it!

## Planned ~~mushrooms~~ features:
- more mushroom stuff 
- some non-mushroom stuff (otherwise the name of the mod would be misleading)

## Feedback/Requests?
Feel free to let me know what's missing from minecraft and perhaps I'll add it.
